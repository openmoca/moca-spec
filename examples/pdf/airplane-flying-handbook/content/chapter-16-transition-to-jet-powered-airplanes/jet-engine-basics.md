# Jet Engine Basics

From Chapter 16: Transition to Jet-Powered Airplanes, pages 16-1 to 16-2 ([PDF](<https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/17_afh_ch16.pdf#page=1>)).

A jet engine is a gas turbine with basic cycle of operation; that is, induction, compression, combustion, expansion, and exhaust. Air passes through the intake and enters the compressor section, which is made up of a series of fan blades or “stages.” The first stage, visible from the front of the engine, is the largest diameter and has the biggest blades. Each subsequent stage contains smaller diameter and thinner blades of increasing pitch. The compression in each stage raises the air temperature and pressure. The highpressure hot air enters the combustion chamber where fuel is added. During engine start, igniters set the fuel air mixture on fire, after which the fire is self-sustaining. The rapidly expanding air flows to the turbine section, which like the compressor section, consists of a series of fan blade stages. The turbine section extracts a portion of the available energy from the airflow to turn a shaft, which drives the compressor. The remaining energy causes rapid air expansion in the nozzle of the tail pipe, accelerates the gas to a high velocity, and produces thrust. \[Figure 16-1\]

The large first stage design of a turbofan engine, a ducted fan, diverts some of the air around the engine core. This cooler bypass air produces some of the thrust. The amount of air that bypasses the core compared to the amount compressed for combustion determines a turbofan’s bypass ratio. In a turbofan engine, the compressor and turbine sections divide into sub-sections. Each sub-section in the turbine section connects to a specific sub-section of the compressor section via a split-spool shaft. \[Figure 16-2\]

Air drawn into the engine for the gas generator is further compressed and constitutes the core airflow. While a turbojet engine uses the entire gas generator’s output to produce thrust in the form of a high-velocity exhaust gas jet, the lower velocity and cooler bypass air produces some of the thrust produced by a turbofan engine.

The turbofan engine design increases the thrust of the jet engine, particularly at lower speeds and altitudes. Although less efficient at higher altitudes, the turbofan engine increases acceleration, decreases the takeoff roll, improves initial climb performance, and often has the effect of decreasing fuel consumption.
